# Reacology-model-sync

**Not functional yet.**

This modelSync will interface [Reacolo](../reacolo) with [ecology](https://github.com/SMU-SIS/ecology) using [cordova-ecology-plugin](https://github.com/SMU-SIS/cordova-ecology-plugin).

However, both [ecology](https://github.com/SMU-SIS/ecology) and [cordova-ecology-plugin](https://github.com/SMU-SIS/cordova-ecology-plugin) are still under development and do not fully implement the requirements for this library to work.
